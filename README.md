## Why?
Current WFH attendance reporting is kind of lame and hard to use. Many of us just got used to use curl and manually write required dates, which might get tricky sometimes.

This Chrome extension is meant to reduce the pain of logging WFHs

## How to install

* Clone repo
* Inside repo run `npm i && npm run build`. This will create a `dist` folder inside repo
* In Chrome: Extensions -> Manage extensions -> Tick `Developer Mode` in the top right corner
* Press `Load unpacked` in top left corner
* Select `dist` folder inside repo


## How to use

* Open attendance page
* Open extension. Now you can select dates as in range picker. If you `dont't` want to omit holdays uncheck `Ignore holidays`. Same for weekdays.
* Press save and w8 a bit
* ???????
* Profit
